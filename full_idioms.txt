A barking dog never bites
A burnt child dreads the fire
A fool and his money are soon parted
A golden key can open any door
A miss is as good as a mile
A woman's place is in the home
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here
Act age!
Act your age!
After a storm comes a calm
Aim for the stars!
Ain't it the truth?
All cats are gray in the dark
All good things must end
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An eye for an eye
And how!
And that's that
And you?
And your point is?
Are we away?
Are we having fun yet?
Art is long and life is short
As I live and breathe!
As the actress said to the bishop...
As the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined
Ask no questions and hear no lies

Banbury story of a cock and a bull
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Been there, done that got the T-shirt
Believe nothing of what you hear, and only half of what you see
Better be an old man's darling than a young man's slave
Better be the head of a dog than the tail of a lion
Better keep still about it
Better luck next time
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know
Bite the ice!
Bottoms up!

Cross the stream where it is shallowest
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut the comedy!
Cut the crap!
Darby and Joan
Death is the great leveler
Desert and reward seldom keep company
Diligence is the mother of good luck
Discretion is the better part of valor
Discretion is the better part of valour
Do bears crap in the woods?
Do bears poop in the woods?
Do bears shit in the woods?
Do we have to go through all that again?

Dunkirk spirit

Eat to live, not live to eat
Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die
Elvis has left the building
Empty vessels make the most sound
Every dog has its day
Every dog will have its day
Every man for himself
Every man is the architect of his own fortune
Everything in the garden is rosy
Everything's going to be all right
Everything’s going to be okay
Example is better than precept
Experience is the best teacher
Experience is the father of wisdom
Experience is the teacher of fools
Feed a cold and starve a fever
Fields have eyes, and woods have ears
Fill in the blanks
Fine feathers make fine birds
Fine words butter no parsnips
Fire is a good servant but a bad master
First impressions are the most lasting
Fish or cut bait
Football's a game of two halves.
For Pete’s sake!

Give a dog a bad name

Great oaks from little acorns grow, and Mighty oaks from little ...
Greetings and felicitations!
Half a loaf is better than none
Half the truth is often a whole lie
Half the world knows not how the other half lives
Hang it all!
Hang loose!
Hang on a mo
Hang on to your hat!
Happy is the bride that the sun shines on
Happy is the country which has no history
Has the cat got tongue?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
He that would eat the kernel must crack the nut
He that would have eggs must endure the cackling of hens
He that would the daughter win, must with the mother first begin
He who begins many things, finishes but few
He who fights and runs away, may live to fight another day
He who pays the piper calls the tune
He who sups with the devil should have a long spoon
He who would climb the ladder must begin at the bottom
Heaven protects children and drunken men
Hellfire and damnation!
Hell’s bells and buckets of blood!

How do you do
How goes it?
How the mighty have fallen
How're things going?
How's my boy?
How's the family?
How's the wife?
How's the world treating you?
Hunger is the best sauce
I believe we've met
I can live with that
I could tell you but then I’d have to kill you
I didn't catch that remark. and I didn't get that.; I didn't hear you
I didn't catch the name, and I didn't catch your name
I don't want to alarm you, but
I don't want to sound like a busybody, but
I gave at the office
I had a lovely time
I hear what you're saying, and I hear you
I hope all goes well
I must'll love you and leave you
I take the Fifth
I wasn't brought up in the woods to be scared by owls
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy
I'd like a word with you. and Could I have a word with you?
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
I'll have the same
I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't
I've had a lovely time
I've never [felt etc.] in all my days!
I've seen better heads on nickel beers
Idle people have the least leisure
Idleness is the root of all evil
If Mohammed will not go to the mountain, the mountain must come to ...
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again

If the cap fits
If the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet must go to the ...
If the shoe fits
If the shoe fits, wear it
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen

If you lie down with dogs, you will get up with fleas
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
In a pig's eye!
In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king
Is my face red!
Is the glass half empty or half full?
Is the pope a Catholic?
It is better to be born lucky than rich
It is better to give than to receive
It is better to travel hopefully than to arrive
It is better to wear out than to rust out
It is easy to be wise after the event
It is not work that kills, but worry
It is the pace that kills
It isn't worth the trouble
It would take an act of Congress to do
It'll all come out in the wash
It'll end in tears
It's a dog's life
It's all over bar the shouting
It's all over but the shouting
It's all the same to me
It's always darkest just before the dawn
It's easy to be wise after the event
It's feeding time at the zoo!
It's not over until the fat lady sings
It's not the heat, it's the humidity
It's raining cats and dogs!
It's raining pitchforks
It's the berries

Knock it off!
Laugh and the world laughs with you; weep and you weep alone
Laughter is the best medicine
Lend your money and lose your friend
Let the buyer beware
Let the chips fall where they may
Let the cobbler stick to his last
Let the dead bury the dead
Let's do this again
Let's get the show on the road

Let’s do lunch sometime
Let’s do the lunch thing
Life is short and time is swift
Life isn't all beer and skittles
Little and often fills the purse
Little thieves are hanged, but great ones escape
Live by the sword, die by the sword
Lo and behold!
Look at what the cat dragged in!
Look what the cat dragged in!
Look what the cat's dragged in!
Loose lips sink ships
Lots of luck!

Lovely weather for ducks
M. and M.s
Man cannot live by bread alone
Man does not live by bread alone
Many are called but few are chosen
March comes in like a lion, and goes out like a lamb
May the best man win
Maybe some other time
Money is the root of all evil
More fool!
Mum's the word
Necessity is the mother of invention
Needs must when the devil drives
Never halloo till you are out of the woods
Never make a threat you cannot carry out
Never speak ill of the dead
Nice going!
Nice weather we're having
None but the brave deserve the fair
Not if I see you sooner, and Not if I see you first
Not in a thousand years! and Never in a thousand years!
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing is certain but the unforeseen
Nothing so bad but might have been worse
Now you're on the trolley
Of all the nerve!
One cannot love and be wise
One hand for oneself and one for the ship
One has to draw the line somewhere
One of these days is none of these days
Onwards and upwards!
Opportunity knocks but once
Out of the mouths of babes
People who live in glass houses
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
Perish the thought
Perish the thought!
Piss or get off the can!
Possession is nine-tenths of the law
Prevention is better than cure
Procrastination is the thief of time
Pull the other leg!
Punctuality is the soul of business
Put that in your pipe and smoke it!
Put the flags out!
Put your trust in God, and keep your powder dry
Read the fucking FAQ!
Read the fucking instructions!
Read the fucking manual!
Rise and shine!
Sam and Dave
Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit
Second place is the first loser.
See you in the funny pages
Seek and ye shall find
Self-preservation is the first law of nature
Serve a purpose
Set a beggar on horseback, and he'll ride to the devil
Shit or get off the can!
Shit or get off the pot!
Shut the stable door after the horse has bolted
Siegfried and Roy
Smokey the Bear
Step on it!
Sticks and stones may break my bones
Stone the crows!
Stop the music!
Stop the music! Hold everything!
Stop the presses! Hold everything!
Stuff and nonsense!
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof
T. and A
Take a long walk off a short pier
Take a running jump in the lake!
Take the bitter with the sweet
Take the goods the gods provide
Take the rough with the smooth
Tell it to the marines!
Tell the truth and shame the devil
Thanks
Thanks for the ride
Thanks, but no thanks
That ain't the way I heard it
That brings me to the point
That takes the cake!
That was a [game etc.] and a half!
That'll be the day!
That's a fine how-do-you-do
That's about the size of it
That's my story and I'm sticking to it
That's one for the books
That's the spirit!
That's the stuff!
That's the ticket!
That's the way it goes
That's the way the ball bounces
That's the way the cookie crumbles
That’ll be the day!
That’s about the size of it
That’s the stuff!
That’s the ticket!
That’s the way the ball bounces
That’s the way the cookie crumbles
That’s the way the mop flops
That’s the way to go!
The Fed
The Force
The age of miracles is past
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The bird has flown
The blind leading the blind
The buck stops here
The butler did it
The darkest hour is just before the dawn
The devil finds work for idle hands
The early bird catches the worm
The end justifies the means
The exception proves the rule
The game is not worth the candle.
The game's up!
The gods send nuts to those who have no teeth
The good is the enemy of the best
The grass is always greener
The grass is always greener on the other side
The greater the truth, the greater the libel
The hand that rocks the cradle
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
The hell you say!
The honeymoon is over
The lights are on but nobody's-one's home
The mind boggles
The more the merrier
The pen is mightier than the sword
The plot thickens
The proof of the pudding
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
The scales fall from eyes
The show must go on
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak
The very idea!
The wages of sin is death
The wish is father to the thought
The wolf is at the door
The world is oyster
The worm has turned
There are plenty of fish in the sea
There aren't enough hours in the day
There but for the grace of God
There is a tide in the affairs of men
There is a time and a place for everything
There is more to than meets the eye
There is no rest for the weary
There is nothing new under the sun
There wasn't a dry eye in the house
There will be hell to pay
There's a time and a place
There's life in the old dog yet
There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip
There's many a slip twixt cup and lip
There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's no peace for the wicked!
There's no time like the present
They also serve who only stand and wait
They broke the mould when they made
Things will work out
This is the life!
Those were the days!
Three strikes and you are out
Throw dirt enough, and some will stick
Time and tide wait for no man
Time hangs heavy on hands
Time is of the essence
Times change and we with time
To the victors belong the spoils
Today here, tomorrow the world
Tom, Dick and Harry
Tom, Dick, and Harry
Too many chiefs and not enough Indians
Too many cooks spoil the stew
Travel broadens the mind
Truth, justice, and the American Way
Try me
Two can play this game
Two heads are better than one
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
United we stand, divided we fall
Up to neck in alligators
Variety is the spice of life
Wake up and smell the coffee!
We aim to please
We have to do lunch sometime
We must learn to walk before we can run
We were just talking about you
We've got a right one here!

You and what army?
You and who else?
You better believe it!
You can bet the farm
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink
You can't judge a book by its cover
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You cannot have your cake and eat it
You cannot serve God and mammon
You cannot teach an old dog new tricks
You could have knocked me down with a feather!
You could have knocked me over with a feather
You don't change horses in the middle of the race.
You don't know the half of it
You don’t know the half of it
You had better believe it!
You heard the man
You live and learn
You make a better door than you do a window
You never know till you try
You never miss the water till the well runs dry
You pays your money and you takes your chance
You scared the hell out of me
You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
You the man!
You'll get the hang of it
You're a fine one to talk!
You're in the army now!
You're the doctor
Young men may die, but old men must die
Your mileage may vary. and YMMV
You’re the doctor
You’re the man!
