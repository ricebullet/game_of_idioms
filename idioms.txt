A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A blessing in disguise
A chip on your shoulder
A dime a dozen
A doubting thomas
A drop in the bucket
A fool and his money are easily parted
A house divided against itself cannot stand
A leopard can't change his spots
A penny saved is a penny earned
A picture paints a thousand words
A piece of cake
A slap on the wrist
A taste of your own medicine
A toss-up
Actions speak louder than words
Add fuel to the fire
Against the clock
All bark and no bite
All greek to me
All in the same boat
An arm and a leg
An axe to grind
Apple of my eye
As high as a kite
At the drop of a hat
Back seat driver
Back to square one
Back to the drawing board
Baker's dozen
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat a dead horse
Beating around the bush
Bend over backwards
Between a rock and a hard place
Bite off more than you can chew
Bite your tongue
Blood is thicker than water
Blue moon
Break a leg
Buy a lemon
Can't cut the mustard
Cast iron stomach
Charley horse
Chew someone out
Chip on his shoulder
Chow down
Close but no cigar
Cock and bull story
Come hell or high water
Crack someone up
Cross your fingers
Cry over spilt milk
Cry wolf
Cup of joe
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut to the chase
Dark horse
Dead ringer
Devil's advocate
Dog days of summer
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Doozy
Down to the wire
Drastic times call for drastic measures
Drink like a fish
Drive someone up the wall
Dropping like flies
Dry run
Eighty six
Elvis has left the building
Ethnic cleansing
Every cloud has a silver lining
Everything but the kitchen sink
Excuse my french
Cock and bull story
Cock and bull story
Feeding frenzy
Field day
Finding your feet
Finger lickin' good
Fixed in your ways
Flash in the pan
Flea market
Flesh and blood
Flip the bird
Foam at the mouth
Fools' gold
French kiss
From rags to riches
Fuddy-duddy
Full monty
Funny farm
Get down to brass tacks
Get over it
Get up on the wrong side of the bed
Get your walking papers
Give him the slip
Go down like a lead balloon
Go for broke
Go out on a limb
Go the extra mile
Good samaritan
Graveyard shift
Great minds think alike
Green room
Gut feeling
Haste makes waste
Hat trick
Have an axe to grind
He lost his head
Head over heels
Hell in a handbasket
High five
High on the hog
Hit the books
Hit the hay
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the sack
Hocus pocus
Hold your horses
Icing on the cake
Idle hands are the devil's tools
If it's not one thing, it's another
In like flynn
In the bag
In the buff
In the heat of the moment
In your face
It takes two to tango
It's a small world
Its anyone's call
Ivy league
Jaywalk
Joshing me
Keep an eye on him
Keep body and soul together
Keep your chin up
Kick the bucket
Kitty-corner
Knee jerk reaction
Knock on wood
Know the ropes
Last but not least
Lend me your ear
Let bygones be bygones
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the cat out of the bag
Level playing field
Like a chicken with its head cut off
Liquor someone up
Long in the tooth
Loose cannon
Make no bones about
Method to my madness
Mumbo jumbo
Mum's the word
Nest egg
Never bite the hand that feeds you
New kid on the block
New york minute
No dice
No room to swing a cat
Not playing with a full deck
Off on the wrong foot
Off the hook
Off the record
On pins and needles
On the fence
On the same page
Out of the blue
Out on a limb
Out on the town
Over my dead body
Over the top
Pass the buck
Pedal to the metal
Peeping tom
Pick up your ears
Pig in a poke
Pig out
Pipe down
Practice makes perfect
Pull the plug
Pulling your leg
Put a sock in it
Raincheck
Raining cats and dogs
Ring fencing
Rise and shine
Rome was not built in one day
Rule of thumb
Run out of steam
Saved by the bell
Scapegoat
Scot-free
Sick as a dog
Sitting shotgun
Sixth sense
Skid row
Smell a rat
Smell something fishy
Son of a gun
Southpaw
Spitting image
Start from scratch
The ball is in your court
The best of both worlds
The bigger they are the harder they fall
The last straw
The whole nine yards
Third times a charm
Tie the knot
Til the cows come home
To make a long story short
To steal someone's thunder
Tongue-in-cheek
Turn a blind eye
Twenty three skidoo
Under the weather
Up a blind alley
Use your loaf
Van gogh's ear for music
Variety is the spice of life
Wag the dog
Water under the bridge
Wear your heart on your sleeve
When it rains, it pours
When pigs fly
Wild and woolly
Wine and dine
Without a doubt
X marks the spot
You are what you eat
You can't judge a book by its cover
You can't take it with you
Your guess is as good as mine
Zero tolerance
